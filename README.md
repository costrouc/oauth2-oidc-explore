# OAuth2 / OpenID Playground

We are using Keycloak and Dex as OAuth servers for testing

This is a working example implementing the Oauth2 standard for clients for learning purposes using a minimal standard library.

Implemented:
 - implicit
 - client credentials
 - authorization code
 - resource owner password flow

# TODO

[Implement PKCE flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/authorization-request/)
